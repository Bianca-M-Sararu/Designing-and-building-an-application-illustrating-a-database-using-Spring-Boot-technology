# Designing-and-building-an-application-illustrating-a-database-using-Spring-Boot-technology
The description is attached in the README file.

The purpose of this project is to highlight how to model and implement an M:N relationship between entities in a database using a specific technology, such as the one chosen - Spring Boot.
The relationship between musicians and albums is managed through an
intermediate table, called songs , which transforms the M:N association into two associations - (1:N) musicians - songs and (1:N) albums - songs . The project will include a Spring Boot application that provides a RESTful API for managing these entities, with functionalities such as adding, updating, deleting and querying data.
